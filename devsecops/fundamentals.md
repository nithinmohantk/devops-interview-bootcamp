# DevSecOps Fundamentals üõ°Ô∏è

## Core DevSecOps Concepts

### 1. What is DevSecOps and how does it differ from DevOps?

**Answer:**
DevSecOps integrates security practices within the DevOps process, making security a shared responsibility throughout the software development lifecycle.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | DevOps | DevSecOps |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Security Focus** | Security as afterthought | Security integrated throughout |
| **Responsibility** | Dev + Ops teams | Dev + Sec + Ops teams |
| **Testing** | Functional and performance | Includes security testing |
| **Deployment** | Fast deployment | Secure and fast deployment |
| **Culture** | Collaboration between dev/ops | Security-first culture |

**Core Principles:**
- **Shift Left Security**: Security testing early in development
- **Automation**: Automated security testing and compliance
- **Collaboration**: Security as shared responsibility
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security assessment
- **Compliance as Code**: Automated compliance checking

### 2. What is "Shift Left" security?

**Answer:**
Shift Left security means integrating security practices earlier in the software development lifecycle rather than at the end.

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí [Security Testing] ‚Üí Production
```

**Shift Left Approach:**
```
[Security] Plan ‚Üí [Security] Code ‚Üí [Security] Build ‚Üí [Security] Test ‚Üí [Security] Deploy ‚Üí Production
```

**Implementation Strategies:**

### 4. What is the principle of "Security as Code"?

**Answer:**
Security as Code treats security policies, configurations, and tests as code that can be versioned, tested, and automated.

**Key Components:**

**Policy as Code:**
```yaml
# Example: Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
    not starts_with(input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image, "approved-registry.com/")
    msg := "Only images from approved registry are allowed"
}
```

**Compliance as Code:**
```yaml
# Example: InSpec compliance test
describe port(443) do
  it { should be_listening }
  its('protocols') { should include 'tcp' }
end

describe ssl(port: 443) do
  its('protocols') { should include 'TLSv1.2' }
  its('ciphers') { should_not include 'RC4' }
end
```

**Security Configuration as Code:**
```yaml
# Example: Terraform security configuration
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Version Control**: Track security changes over time
- **Automation**: Automated policy enforcement
- **Consistency**: Standardized security configurations
- **Scalability**: Apply security at scale

### 5. What are the OWASP Top 10 and how do they relate to DevSecOps?

**Answer:**
The OWASP Top 10 represents the most critical web application security risks.

**OWASP Top 10 (2021):**

1. **Broken Access Control**: Unauthorized access to resources
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Weak encryption or exposed sensitive data
3. **Injection**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
4. **Insecure Design**: Fundamental security design flaws
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Improper security settings
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using components with known vulnerabilities
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Weak authentication mechanisms
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Insecure CI/CD pipelines
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Inadequate logging and monitoring
